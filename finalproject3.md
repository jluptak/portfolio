## audience

The audience for my final data story is one that is familiar with the Mueller investigation and has heard that Russia allegedly tried to influence the presidential election, but does not have any additional information other than that. To serve this audience, I kept my visualizations simple so that there is only really one takeaway for each chart, and organized them under a header that primes them to understand - e.g., "Facebook ads targeted racial divides" - so they know what to look for when they interact with the data.

## the way here

This project was much harder than I initially anticipated, and I found myself fighting with the data a lot. In the future, I would pick more readily available data with a more quantitative bent - as it is, I'm not sure that I've executed on the compelling story that is in my head.

I think the most important thing I learned throughout the process is the important of user feedback. It was something that would've been very easy to skip, but was ultimately critical in helping me hone my visualizations and letting go of things I thought were important that ultimately were not.
