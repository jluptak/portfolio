### russian disinformation campaign

#### outline
My final project is a visual exploration of Russia's disinformation campaign during the 2016 Presidential election. The goal is to inform the audience, and to bring a more personal understanding to the buzzword-y "Russia investigation."

#### structure
**setup:** In 2016, Russia attempted to interfere in the United States presdiential election, using both "soft" techniques like social media disinformation as well as direct attacks on the Democratic National Committee. Their social engineering efforts focused on ideological divides in the United States and aimed to spread distrust.

**conflict:** Disinformation campaigns are scary, not least of all because they target existing biases and, when done well, can be difficult to identify 

**resolution:** Understanding the tactics used in the last attempt at election interference can inform users what to watch for when - not if - it happens again.

#### the data
The House Intelligence Committee released known-malicious Facebook ads purchased by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the Russian troll farm primarily responsible for the country's disinformation campaign. That data includes Ad Text; Ad Landing Page; Ad Targeting Location, Age, Language, Placements and People Who Match; Ad Impressions; Ad Clicks; Ad Spend; and Ad Creation Date. (Note: the information is currently in PDF form, but I am in the process of converting it to a workable .csv file.)

### method & medium
There are two main stories I want to tell with the data: who was targeted and how it was done (e.g., 18-35 year-olds were sent to Instagram, while 65+ were invited to Facebook groups), and how Russia's tactics changed overtime (e.g., in February during the Iowa caucus when there were multiple candidates, versus in October approaching the general election).
