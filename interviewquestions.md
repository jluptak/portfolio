## User Research Questions

### Questions for each visualization - 
"Considering the [timeline / alluvial diagram / line chart]..."

1. What do yo think this [infographic / graph] is telling you?
2. Is there anything you find confusing?
3. *Is there anything you would change or do differently?

*NOTE: While I had originally intended to ask subjects for specific feedback, I found that all of them naturally offered solutions to what they found confusing without prompting.

### Questions for all three visualizations - 
"Considering all three graphs..."

1. What narrative do you think these visualizations are telling?
2. What, if anything, did you learn from these visualizations?
