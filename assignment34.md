The Data Visualization Effectiveness exercise laid the groundwork for this redesign. It helped me hone in on three main points that I wanted to change: the use of technical jargon, the organization and the color scheme. I knew almost immediately that I wanted to use a map, which I see as an intuitive choice when demonstrating election-related data. I also planned to cut back on the vocabulary, and intentionally selected non-cybersecurity colleagues for my wireframe interviews.

My first wireframe attempted to cut back on the busyness of the original visualization, but in interviews it was apparent I had gone too far. While both subjects could easily understand the gist of what was being shown - different states' methods of voting - they weren't able to speak to the greater takeaway. It wasn't quite "so what," but it was clear that they weren't sure of the significance. As a result, I added the "takeaway" icons to the top to call out the big stories that the data illustrated. Both interviewees liked this change, and one thought it would be encourage interaction in the final version.

Ultimately, the redesign shows the future state of election security, including a return to paper ballots or electronic ballots with paper trails, and the outlier states that have no auditability. As noted, I tried to remove the technical jargon - replacing acronyms with the more universally understood "paper trail" terminology - and leverage the map to create recognition even if the subject matter is foreign. I also streamlined some of the information, rolling two data points that were initially listed as their own category into a subset of an existing one. Finally, from a color perspective, I chose purple - it combines the blue and red commonly associated with electorial maps, and speaks to the fact that election security is a bipartisan issue.
