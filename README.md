This is my public profile for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# about me
My name is Jennie Luptak, and I'm a second-year grad student studying Information Security Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon. After graduation, I'll be joining Deloitte's Government & Public Services practice in Washington, D.C. Prior to attending CMU, I received my BA in business administration from the University of Pittsburgh, and worked in ecommerce for a Fortune 500 retailer.

# what i hope to learn
Tableau! But more generally, I hope to apply data visualization techniques to the cyber security realm. I'm not sure what that will look like (e.g., maps of individual attacks or exploration of larger industry trends) but cyber security requires such a specialized knowledge set that I'm eager to democratize data and stories such that they are impactful to non-specialists.
