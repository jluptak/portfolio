This is my public profile for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# about me
I'm a second-year grad student at Carnegie Mellon, studying Information Security Policy & Management at the Heinz College. After graduation, I'll be joining Deloitte's Government & Public Services practice in Washington, D.C.

# what i hope to learn
Tableau! But more generally, I hope to apply data visualization techniques to the cyber security realm. I'm not sure what that will look like (e.g., maps of individual attacks or exploration of larger industry trends) but cyber security requires such a specialized knowledge set that I'm eager to try and democratize the data and stories such that they are impactful to non-specialists.
